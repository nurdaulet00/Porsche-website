    <h2>Design, Style, Comfort & Luxury</h2>
    <p>The design and style of Porsche cars is a story of elegance, innovation and a unique combination of sportiness and luxury. Each model of this German manufacturer is not just a vehicle, but a true work of art that declares its individuality on the road.

      One of the key features of Porsche design is its effective simplicity. Clean lines and refined forms give the impression of unquestioning harmony, while the minimalist approach to detail emphasises the pursuit of perfection. Every curve, every protruding tool looks thoughtful and functional, which is characteristic of Porsche sports cars.
      
      In addition to its aesthetics, Porsche design is characterised by exceptional functionality. All exterior and interior elements are designed to maximise driver and passenger comfort. Unique features such as distinctive lightweight alloys, aerodynamic shapes and striking colour schemes make Porsche cars recognisable at a glance.
      
      The interiors of Porsche cars are also the epitome of luxury and modernity. High-quality materials, innovative technologies and attention to detail create an atmosphere that combines comfort and outstanding functionality. Every element of the interior reflects attention to design as well as a commitment to creating a unique and distinctive space.
      
      Overall, Porsche's design and styling epitomise the brand's philosophy, where aesthetics meets performance and innovation emphasises tradition. When you get behind the wheel of a Porsche, you are not just driving a car - you are interacting with a work of art on wheels that not only fulfils your mobility needs, but also brings pleasure to the process.</p>

    <h2>Racing Achievements</h2>
    <p>The brand is actively involved in motorsport, winning famous races such as the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Porsche's sporting achievements emphasise not only its high-speed qualities, but also its unrivalled technical competence.
      Porsche may not boast such a long racing history as, say, Peugeot, Maserati, Bentley, Bugatti or Alfa Romeo, but Porsche's history is so tightly connected with motorsport that it is impossible to imagine one without the other. Their victories in the most famous races of all times and peoples have long been written in the history of motorsport, their cars were created on race tracks, and everything they learnt in races was immediately transferred to their road versions.

Porsche took part in all disciplines of motorsport: hill climb, rally, circuit, Formula 1 and even Indycar, but, of course, they got the maximum fame in circuit racing, more precisely - in Le Mans, where their prototypes and bodies won one victory after another for many years. But in open-wheel racing they failed, and the reason for this was not so much design errors or flaws, but rather the "human factor". Their last start in the formula series was in 1990 in "Indycar". And 30 years later, they again risked to try their hand in this category of racing: this time building cars for participation in Formula E.
